# Test strategy
![demo1](demo1.jpg "Title")

            Test strategy is a high-level document that outlines the approach, scope, objectives, and techniques to be used for testing a software application or system. It is a plan that guides the entire testing process and helps ensure that all testing activities are carried out efficiently and effectively. Here are some key elements of a typical test strategy in software testing

            A test strategy is like a plan for how to test a computer program or system. It's like a map that helps the testers know what they need to do and how to do it.

            The test strategy will include things like what parts of the program to test, how to test them (like with a person trying things out or with a computer program doing it automatically), and what to do if they find something wrong (like a bug or mistake).

            It will also say what tools and equipment the testers will need, and how long they will have to do the testing. The plan will be made by the people in charge of testing, and they will decide what things are most important to test and how to do it.

            The test strategy helps make sure that the computer program or system works the way it should, and that any problems are found and fixed before the program is released to the public.

- Test objectives and scope: This section outlines the goals of testing and the areas of the software application or system to be tested.

- Test approach: This section defines the overall approach to be taken for testing, such as whether it will be manual or automated testing, and the level of testing required (e.g., unit, integration, system, acceptance testing).

- Test techniques: This section describes the specific techniques to be used for testing, such as black-box, white-box, or gray-box testing, and the types of testing to be performed, such as functional, non-functional, or regression testing.

- Test environment and infrastructure: This section outlines the hardware, software, and other resources required for testing, such as test environments, test data, and test tools.

- Test deliverables: This section lists the various documents and artifacts that will be produced during testing, such as test plans, test cases, test reports, and defect logs.

- Test schedule and timeline: This section outlines the timeline and schedule for testing, including milestones and deadlines.

- Test organization and responsibilities: This section describes the roles and responsibilities of the testing team members, including testers, test managers, and other stakeholders.

- Test risks and mitigation strategies: This section identifies potential risks and challenges that may arise during testing, and outlines strategies to mitigate them.

The test strategy should be tailored to the specific needs and requirements of the software application or system being tested, and should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.

# Test Plan Vs Test Strategy

- Test Strategy: A test strategy is a high-level document that outlines the approach, scope, objectives, and techniques to be used for testing a software application or system. It describes the overall strategy for testing, and provides a roadmap for the testing activities. It covers the big picture of testing, including what to test, how to test, and who will be involved in testing.

- Test Plan: A test plan is a detailed document that outlines the specific testing activities to be carried out for a particular software application or system. 
        - It describes the individual steps that testers will take to verify that the software meets the requirements and works as expected. It covers the details of testing, including what to test, how to test it, and what criteria to use to determine whether the testing is successful.
