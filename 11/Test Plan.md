# Test Plan

## What is a Test Plan?

* A Test Plan is a detailed document which consist of all future testing related activities.
* Think of it as a blueprint which is prepared by Test Manager or Test Lead for running the tests needed to ensure the software is working correctly.

## Types of Test Plan

* Master Test Plan- In this type of test plan, includes multiple test strategies and has multiple levels of testing.
* Phase Test Plan- In this type of test plan, emphasis on any one phase of testing.
* Specific Test Plan- In this type of test plan, it is designed for specific types of testing especially non-functional testing.

## Steps for creating a Test Plan

* Product Analysis
* Designing Test Strategy
* Defining Objectives
* Establish Test Criteria
* Planning Resource Allocation
* Planning Setup of Test Environment
* Determine test schedule and estimation
* Establish Test Deliverables

##  Test Plan Attributes

* Standard 15 attributes that companies follow :-

1. Objective:
	* It describes the aim of the test plan, whatever the good process and procedure they are going to follow in order to give quality software to customers.
	* In simple words we can say in this we will write what is the aim of writing my test plan / why I am writing my test plan.

2. Test Strategy: 
	* It is a crucial document that is to be performed and usually designed by the Test Manager. 
	* It helps to determine Test Effort and Test cost.
	* The scope can be divided into two parts:
		* In-Scope: The modules that are to be tested carefully.
		* Out Scope: The modules that are not to be tested carefully.

3. Testing Methodology:
	* The methods that are going to be used for testing depend on application to application. 
	* The testing methodology is decided based on the feature and application requirements.
	* In this attribute, depending on our application we have to write that what an all kind of testing we are going to test as a part of my testing.
	* Depending on the application we need to select what an all all kind of testing we are going to test.

4. Approch:
	* The approach of testing different software is different. 
	* It deals with the flow of applications for future references. It has two aspects:-
		* High-Level Scenarios: For testing critical features high-level scenarios are written. For Example, login to a website, booking from a website.
		* The Flow Graph: It is used when one wants to make benefits such as converging and merging easy.
	
5. Assumptions: 
	* In this phase, certain assumptions will be made. Example :-
	* The testing team will get proper support from the development team.
	* The tester will get proper knowledge transfer from the development team.
	* Proper resource allocation will be given by the company to the testing department.

6. Risk: 
	* All the risks that can happen if the assumption is breaking. 
	* For Example, in the case of wrong budget estimation, the cost may overrun. 
	* Some reason that may lead to risk is:
		* Test Manager has poor management skills.
		* Hard to complete the project on time.
		* Lack of cooperation.

7. Backup/Mitigation Plan:
	* If any risk is involved then the company must have a backup plan, the purpose is to avoid errors. 
	* Some points to resolve/avoid risk :-
		* Test priority is to be set for each test activity.
		* Managers should have leadership skills.
		* Training course for the testers.

8. Roles and Responsibilities: 
	* All the responsibilities and role of every member in a particular testing team has to be recorded.
	* Example :-
		* Test Manager: Manages the project, takes an appropriate resource and gives project direction.
		* Tester: Identify the testing technique, verify the test approach, and save project cost.

9. Scheduling:
	* Under this, it will record the start and the end date of each and every testing-related activity. 
	* For Example, writing test case date and ending test case date.

10. Defect Tracking: 
	* It is an important process in software engineering as lots of issue arises when you develop a critical system for business. 
	* If there is any defect found while testing and that defect must be given to the developer team. 
	* There are the following methods for the process of defect tracking :-
		* Information Capture: In this, we take basic information to begin the process.
		* Prioritize: The task is prioritized based on severity and importance.
		* Communicate: Communication between the identifier of bug and fixer of bug.
		* Environment: Test the application based on hardware and software.
	* Example: The bug can be identified using bug tracking tools such as Jira, Mantis, Trac. 

11. Test Environment: 
	* It is the environment which the testing team will use i.e. the list of hardware and software, while testing the application, the things which are said to be tested will be written under this section. 
	* The installation of software is also checked under this.
	* Example :-
		* Software configuration on different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.
		* Hardware Configuration depends on RAM, ROM, etc.

12. Entry and Exit Criteria: 
	* The set of conditions that should be met in order to start any new type of testing or to end any kind of testing.
	* Entry Condition :-
		* Necessary resources must be ready.
		* The application must be prepared.
		* Test data should be ready.
	* Exit Condition :-
		* There should not be any major bug.
		* Most test cases should be passed.
		* When all test cases are executed.

13. Test Automation: 
	* It consists of the features that are to be automated and which features are not to be automated.
		* If the feature has lots of bugs then it is categorized as Manual Testing.
		* If the feature is frequently tested then it can be automated.

14. Deliverables:
	* It is the outcome from the testing team and that is to be given to the customers at the end of the project.
	* Before testing phase :-
		* Test plan document.
		* Test case document.
		* Test design specification.
	* During testing phase :-
		* Test scripts.
		* Test data.
		* Error logs.
	* After testing phase :-
		* Test Reports.
		* Defect Report.
		* Installation Report.
	* It contains a test plan, defect report, automation report, assumption report, tools, and other components that have been used for developing and maintaining the testing effort.

15. Templated: 
	* It is followed by every kind of report that is going to be prepared by the testing team.

## Importance Of Test Plans

* It acts as a quick guide for the testing process.
* It helps to avoid out-of-scope functionalities.
* It determines the time, cost, and effort.
* Provide a schedule for testing activities.
* Resource requirement and equipment.
* Test Plan Document can be used for similar projects.
* It helps to understand the test details.
* It helps in determining the quality of software applications.
